# Delivery Optimization for Collaborative Truck-Drone Routing Problem Considering Vehicle Obstacle Avoidance

This repository comprises the code to learn a  routing policy for the collaborative truck-drone delivery using a structured learning enriched combinatorial optimization pipeline.
The problem setting bases on the [EURO Meets NeurIPS 2022 Vehicle Routing Competition](https://github.com/kfh0609/C-TDRP)



This repository contains all relevant scripts and data sets to reproduce the results from the paper. To run the code for reproducing the results we assume using *tensorflow.keras*.
